Data Structures - Programming assignment #1


The inhertance tree is shown as below:

    *Polygon*
    |
    |---Triangle
    |   |
    |   \---IsoscelesTriangle
    |       |
    |       \---EquilateralTriangle
    |
    |---*Quadrilateral*
    |   |
    |   \---Rectangle
    |       |
    |       \---Square
    |
    |---Pentagon
    |
    |---Hexagon
    |
    \---Octagon

Polygon and Quadrilateral are both interfaces in this implementation.

To compile and run this project, run  

    make all
    
or just

    make
    
or simply  

    g++ main.cpp
    
Then, run the executable generated.  It will prompt you to either choose a shape to create, or run predefined test cases.  Follow the instructions and use as desired.
